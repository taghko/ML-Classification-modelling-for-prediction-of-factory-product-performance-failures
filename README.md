The scope of the project study was predict performance failure of the product that was developed by toy factory for absorption of spills and leaks. Number of measurements were conducted to determine at which conditions product is likely to fail. These data was used for machine learning classification modelling where failure was categorised by 0 and 1. Through in depth Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering exercises including preprocessing pipeline key data were determined as feature for modelling prediction. Popular classification modelling algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, KNeighbors Classifier and GaussianNB were deployed in the study and model with best evaluation metrics was chosen for product failure prediction. From the model evaluation exercise Logistic Regression model showed best performance and model was inferenced with new test data for failure prediciton purposes. This project study is example of typical classification ML modelling work flow with feature engineering and modelling practises.
